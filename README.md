# Phaser Fish Game!

A little browser game make with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/phaser3)!


<br/>


# Origin
This game was initially created by [Jim Lynch](https://github.com/JimLynchCodes), a software engineer who started his career as an Actionscript3 programmer and Flash game developer. He slowly moved over to JavaScript and other interesting programming languages over the years and found himself building lots and lots of software that wasn't games. üò¢ 

During the Covid-19 outbreak Jim decided to get back into 2D game development, and he aspired to make a cool multiplayer game similar to the agar.io browser game. He also had fond memories of games like [Feeding Frenzy](https://kbhgames.com/game/feeding-frenzy) and [Adventure Aquarium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.socialin.android.game.fishadventure&hl=en_US) and so decided to build an underwater themed "eat the smaller fish and don't get eaten by the bigger fish" style game!

<br/>

# Plans

## Single Player Mode
The first goal is to just have a working single-player game where you can eat smaller fish and get eaten by bigger fish. In this game we can work out the main game mechanics and tweak the physics to maximize the amount of fun the users get when playing it!

## Online Mode
After we have a fun single-player game, let's build an online mode similar to make it similar to the agar.io game! This will make it even more fun and awesome! üî•


## Donate Profits To Charity
Like agar.io, we can have subtle adverts on the start screen to fund the cost of our servers. We can put the profits towards charities that support things we care about, such as:

- Preservation of habitats for marine wildlife. &nbsp; üê†

- Benefiting the environment and wildlife in general. &nbsp; üåè

- Teaching people to code and program computers. &nbsp; üíª

- Promoting game development, game design, and animation. &nbsp; üëæ

# Current State

We've got a long way to go until this game is ready to release to users! Here's a screenshot of the current state as of April 5th, 2020.
